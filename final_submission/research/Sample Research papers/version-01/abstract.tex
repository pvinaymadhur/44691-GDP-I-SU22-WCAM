%	 Natural sunlight is widely recognized as the best source for plant growth and development. Some plants might not get enough light throughout the winter and die due lack of maintenance. To promote quicker or even more balanced growth. We want to employ the hydroponics technique, which enables us to provide plants the necessary nutrients in an artificial environment utilizing red and blue LED lights that facilitate photosynthesis in plants. These techniques were interfaced with IoT for controlling the system via the internet. The main objective of this research is to maintain the plants in their natural state by monitoring the factors that increase both plant and human lifetime. This is a Mobile Integrated and smart irrigation system using IOT to control the water supply and monitor the plants environment using a Smartphone.
